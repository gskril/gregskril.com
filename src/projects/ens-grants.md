A [Snapshot-based](https://snapshot.org/) voting app intended to make grant distribution more efficient for [ENS DAO working groups](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-0/ep4-social-proposal-creation-of-foundational-working-groups-and-working-group-rules). I didn't create the initial platform, but have been working on it since the second round.
