This whole space operates entirely on Twitter and Discord. That's the best way to find out about new projects, see what other people are talking about, interact with NFT projects, and meet new people.

Before you join any communities, realize that most people in crypto are completely anonymous (they call it anon). You'll see most accounts have NFTs as their profile picture (pfp), a pseudonymous name, and don't talk about where they're from. Privacy is naturally a big part of crypto, but it can definitely be overwhelming at first if you don't have that expectation when you're first jumping into things.

This is a good example for what a large part of "crypto Twitter" looks like:

Even though you have no idea who you’re talking to, people tend to be surprisingly nice. It truly does fee like a community. Be active in a few Discord servers from NFT projects you like (I explain how to find these below) and you’ll feel this pretty quickly.

## Crypto Twitter accounts to follow
Finding interesting people who talk about crypto and NFTs is a bit tricky to start, but once you do, more interesting people will just start showing up in your feed naturally. To get you started, here are some of my favorites:

- [Alexis Ohanian](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian) - Reddit founder, VC investor
- [Brantly Millegan](https://twitter.com/brantlymillegan) - ENS team (.eth names)
- [Chris Cantino](https://twitter.com/chriscantino) - Sold company to Unilever for $100m+, now VC and crypto
- [ETH Gas Alerts](https://twitter.com/ETHGasAlerts) - Tweets when gas is low (my project)
- [Greg Isenberg](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg) - Community builder
- [JRNY Crypto](https://twitter.com/JRNYcrypto) - General crypto influencer & YouTuber
- [TZ](https://twitter.com/TZhongg) - Cool insights, building a social NFT community platform
- [3Lau](https://twitter.com/3lau) - DJ and founder of [royal](https://twitter.com/join_royal), a way for fans to own parts of their favorite songs as NFTs


## Discord's role in NFTs

While Twitter is the best place to learn about crypto and NFT news in general, Discord communities are more focused on specific projects.

On the top right corner of OpenSea collections, you'll almost always see icons for Twitter and Discord. This is how you'll find out more about the project and interact with people who already own NFT's from that collection, or are interested in buying them.

I suggest joining a handful of Discord communities to observe how people communicate in there, see how things are organized, and get a feel for how this all works. One community I really enjoy and can strongly recommend joining is the [Bull Market Girlfriends Discord](https://discord.gg/5HaGKSEaQy). I'm on the team and very active in there.

You'll find that there's a lot of crypto-specific slang used here which might be confusing at first. I'll be writing a post about this soon, but for now I recommend reading this [Twitter thread about NFT slang](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1433002033242595338). It's quite funny when you get the hang of it. 

The NFT space would be nothing without it's incredibly strong community, and in my opinion, it's what makes the space so fun.
