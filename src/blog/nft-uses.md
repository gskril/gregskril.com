title: What Can NFTs Be Used for Other Than Selling Digital Art?

Let's be honest - the current state of NFTs is rather rudimentary. In my eyes, most people that are currently in the NFT space are in it for the money.

They think that they can buy a generated art piece of some funny looking animal for $250 and sell it for $1,000. And in the current market that's totally plausible. But in my eyes, trading is not the behavior thats going to take NFTs mainstream.

Before diving into what I think _will_ take NFTs mainstream, it's important to understand what an NFT really is. Spoiler: most people misunderstand them.

## What is an NFT, really?

Before getting into the potential NFT use cases outside of trading, it's important to understand what an NFT really is, and what it is not.

**An NFT is not a piece of art.**

**An NFT is a verifiable piece of code that exists on the blockchain.**

Most images that you see shared around as NFTs on social media are actually not part of the NFTs code (also known as a token). The art itself, meaning the jpeg file, does not even exist on the blockchain in most cases! The token, which is what makes the asset uniquely identifiable on the blockchain, simply links to a website that is hosting the image file.

What's the problem with this? Well [if the website that's hosting the image file of your NFT goes offline, then the art associated with your NFT also goes offline](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122).

You own the token, _not_ the art (in most cases).

### Is this really so bad?

Not necessarily, no. Big NFT projects aren't going to all of a sudden remove their image files from the internet. Big projects also usually have utility beyond the art itself.

But for most small NFT projects that flatline after a few months, potentially yes.

As Jonty Wareing, author of a [great twitter thread](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372170724459343874) about this topic said, "It is likely that every NFT sold so far will be broken within a decade."

## Will NFTs hold their value over time?

Most of the current ones, no. This is obviously my opinion, but its a shared opinion across some of the leading minds in this space.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" data-dnt="true" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">99% of NFT’s won’t be good investments and there will be some massive crashes in the next 12 to 24 months .. many will get confused and think it was a fad.. that’s when it gets really good .. this will be an interesting decade ... oh and that 1% will be all-time returns</p>&mdash; Gary Vaynerchuk (@garyvee) <a href="https://twitter.com/garyvee/status/1365883296064954370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 28, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I see the current NFT market landscape as a gold rush. Seemingly everybody's rushing to buy and flip their fancy blockchain assets for a profit, and this is exactly how a lot of people will get burned.

Don't get me wrong - I love NFTs and own many, even in their current state, but that doesn't stop me from saying I think many of them will go to 0 overtime.

## What can NFTs be used for outside of digital art?

Now we get into the exciting part. As I've explained, NFTs are technologically-proven to be unique assets which exist as virtually indestructible code that lives on the [blockchain](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp).

This means that NFTs are a a great way to prove ownership of basically anything. Some of the first use cases that come to mind are:

- Tickets to an event
- Equity in a company
- Loyalty status to brands
- Part ownership of a song
- Virtual assets in a video game
- Exclusive membership to a club
- Digital wearables for the metaverse
- Exclusive merchandise for VIP customers

The example that I use to explain the future of NFTs to friends is concert tickets.

### Why NFTs should be used as tickets to live events

Imagine the current process of buying a ticket for a concert from your favorite band. You buy the ticket, use it to get into the event, then it loses 100% of its value. The lifespan of that ticket is just 1 day.

But what if the band wants to create a community chat of everybody who attended the event? Or what if they want to reward fans who have been to 5+ concerts? Or what if they want to do a giveaway amongst the people who attended a certain concert? Or what if they want to give everybody at the concert a digital collectible that represents they attended a special event?

With NFTs, that is all made possible and very easy.

A band can create and list a set of NFTs for sale, and their fans can buy them as tickets. If a fan realizes they can no longer make it to the event, they can sell their ticket on a secondary marketplace. Heading to the event, attendees can verify their NFT ownership as a way to get into the venue. Up to this point, its the same process as a traditional online ticket.

After the event, ticket holders are invited to join a token-gated community. This means that only people who own that NFT are able to join the group.

Also, people who own 5+ tickets get access to another, even more exclusive chat with VIP fans. This is where you'll be able to interact with the band themselves most easily.

It's important to realize here that since these tickets are NFTs, they're also tradeable at any point. So if I want to get the benefits of a VIP fan but have only been to once concert, I'll have to buy 4 more of the ticket NFTs on the secondary market. And when you think about it, Secondary market sales are good for all parties.

NFTs have everlasting royalties, meaning if I buy an NFT for $100 from the band and then sell it to a friend for $200, the band gets a percentage of that $200. This incentivizes the band to reward their fans, because it promotes secondary sales which makes them money. This is also good for fans, because they have an opportunity to sell their tickets after a concert if they'd rather recoup some of their ticket cost rather than get exclusive long-term benefits.

Happy band, happy fan, happy collector.

Beyond exclusive communities, bands could also create limited edition physical merchandise that only VIP fans can purchase like many NFT projects have done. The opportunities are endless once there's a reliable way to authenticate digital ownership of something.

## Tools used to create a token-gated community

### NFT Tickets with POAP

[POAP](https://poap.xyz/), or Proof of Attendance Protocol, makes it easy for any brand or individual to create NFT tickets to an event, or create redeemable tokens as a sort of collectible form a given event. As they define it, POAP s an open-source project that "enables a new way of keeping long-lasting records of life experiences".

The largest brand to adopt POAP as of the time of writing is Adidas with their [adidas Originals: our future started here](https://poap.gallery/event/14195) event. These tickets are currently selling on the secondary marketplace for ~$3500 USD even though there is no immediate use case.

> "This digital collectible is our way of rewarding you for following your curiosity....this token proves you were here from the beginning of this journey. Keep it safe — it may come in handy."

It's become very clear that Adidas is heavily investing in this space, so people feel as if this ticket will be extremely valuable in the future.

### Token gating a Discord community

As you might have read in my post "[How to Get More Involved in the Crypto and NFT Community](/blog/nft-community/)"**,** NFT communities operate largely on Discord. If you don't know how Discord works, each community has its own server. And within a server there are channels. Each channel can have different permissions, meaning each channel can be gated in a different way.

The way most NFT projects utilize Discord is there will be some channels that are open to everyone - you don't need to own anything in order to participate in the conversation. Alongside those, some channels will be for NFT owners only. So you must own an NFT from a specific collection in order to see that channel.

There are multiple tools that allow token gating in Discord, but the most popular amongst NFT projects is [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/). This works for almost any NFT collection, including POAPs.

### Discord alternatives for token-gated chats

[Ourspaces.xyz](http://Ourspaces.xyz) is the easiest way I've seen to create a token-gated group chat by far. You simply enter the contract address for the NFT, enter how many the person must own, and press create!

Hopefully now you have a better idea of what NFTs can be used for beyond just trading drawings of funny animals, and how that might actually look in practice.
