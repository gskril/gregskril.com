        <p>I grew up in New York, recently graduated college in Philadelphia, and now traveling while working remotely in web3.</p>
        <p>I've been building basic websites since the beginning of high school but just started diving deeper into coding in May of 2021. My first "real" coding project was a <a href="https://doge.gregskril.com/">cryptocurrency trading bot</a>. This led me down the path of exploring web3/crypto in more detail until I really started spending all my time in the space by August of 2021. I've been going further down the rabbit hole ever since.</p>
        <p>My approach to web3 is to <a href="/projects">learn by building</a>. I don't consider myself a great developer by technical standards, but enjoy rapidly prototyping ideas and experimenting as much as possible.</p>
